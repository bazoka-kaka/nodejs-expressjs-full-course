# HTTP REQUEST OR RESPONSE CYCLE

- how we exchange data with the web

- everytime we open up a browser
  and we type the url (the web address)
  we're performing a request and we're
  requesting to the server
  <br><br>
  then after requesting to the server
  you're gonna get the response
  from the server
  <br><br>
  this is done using http protocol
  and that's why these are called http
  messages

- servers is just computers, but no guis,
  much bigger than most computers,
  its job is to make sure some resource is available

- request messages are what the users
  send
