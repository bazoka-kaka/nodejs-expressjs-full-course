FS MODULE (sync)
================

FS MODULE (SYNC)
----------------
- synchronously meaning blocking 

- readFileSync() 
this is gonna read all the content of 
the file 

- writeFileSync()
this is gonna write the content of 
a file 

note:
this is gonna have 2 params:
1. the file path
2. the text 
3. the flag 
e.g:
{ flag: 'a'}
this is gonna mean that you're appending 
to the file if the file already has content

final code:
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require("fs");

const first = readFileSync("./content/first.txt", "utf-8");
const second = readFileSync("./content/second.txt", "utf-8");

console.log(first, second);

writeFileSync(
  "./content/result-sync.txt",
  `Here is the result ${first} ${second}\n`,
  { flag: "a" }
);
