# EVENTS EMITTER - ADDITIONAL INFO

1. we can have as many methods as we
   want
   <br>
   example:

```
//common practice is to name this EventEmitter
const EventEmitter = require("events");

const customEmitter = new EventEmitter();

customEmitter.on("response", function () {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Data received`);
});

customEmitter.on("response", function () {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Some other logic here`);
});

customEmitter.emit("response");
```

output:
<br>
Data received
<br>
Some other logic here

2. this orders matter
   <br>
   meaning we have to listen to
   the response first then we could emit
   <br><br>
   if we emit first before listening
   to the response, then the code
   won't work

3. we can pass the arguments
   when we're omitting the event
   <br>
   example:
   <br>

```
//common practice is to name this EventEmitter
const EventEmitter = require("events");

const customEmitter = new EventEmitter();

customEmitter.on("response", function (name, id) {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Data received ${name}, ${id}`);
});

customEmitter.on("response", function () {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Some other logic here`);
});

customEmitter.emit("response", "Yehezkel", 20);
```

output:
<br>
Data received Yehezkel, 20
<br>
Some other logic here
