# STREAMS - READ FILES

- use case:
  <br>
  using streams when we're reading files
  because we need to understand one
  thing:
  <br>
  when we use the sync approach,
  what happens: we're reading the whole
  file
  <br><br>
  but if we have a big file
  you're just using all of that memory
  and as the file gets bigger and bigger
  the variable isn't gonna be good enough
  (the size is too big and you can't put
  anything in the string anymore)
  <br><br>
  solution:
  <br>
  read stream option
  <br><br>
  example:
  <br>
  first create a big file:

```
const { writeFileSync } = require("fs");
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
  //
  writeFileSync("./components/bigFile.txt", `Hello World ${i}\n`, {
    flag: "a",
  });
}
```

we read it like this:

```
const { createReadStream } = require("fs");

const stream = createReadStream("./components/bigFile.txt", "utf-8");

stream.on("data", function (data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```
