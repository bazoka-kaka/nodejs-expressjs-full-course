OS MODULES
==========

- os modules provides many methods for us to interact
with the operating system also the server 

- because this is a built in module, we don't need
to install anything

- getting useful info about the current user:
const os = require("os");

//info about current user
const user = os.userInfo();
console.log(user);

output:
<info about user> 

- system uptime 
const os = require('os');

//method returns the system uptime in seconds
console.log(`The system uptime is ${os.uptime()} seconds`);

output:
The system uptime is 61819 seconds

note:
this is how long the computer has been running 
in seconds 

- info about our operating system 
//info about current operating system
const currentOS = {
  name: os.type(),
  release: os.release(),
  totalMem: os.totalmem(),
  freeMem: os.freemem(),
};

console.log(currentOS);

output:
<info about curr os>

this is the final code:
const os = require("os");

//info about current user
const user = os.userInfo();
console.log(user);

//method returns the system uptime in seconds
console.log(`The system uptime is ${os.uptime()} seconds`);

//info about current operating system
const currentOS = {
  name: os.type(),
  release: os.release(),
  totalMem: os.totalmem(),
  freeMem: os.freemem(),
};

console.log(currentOS);
