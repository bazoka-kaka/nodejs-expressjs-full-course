EVENTS EMITTER - ADDITIONAL INFO 
================================

1. we can have as many methods as we 
want 

example:
//common practice is to name this EventEmitter
const EventEmitter = require("events");

const customEmitter = new EventEmitter();

customEmitter.on("response", function () {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Data received`);
});

customEmitter.on("response", function () {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Some other logic here`);
});

customEmitter.emit("response");

output:
Data received 
Some other logic here 

2. this orders matter

meaning we have to listen to 
the response first then we could emit 

if we emit first before listening 
to the response, then the code 
won't work 

3. we can pass the arguments 
when we're omitting the event 

example:
//common practice is to name this EventEmitter
const EventEmitter = require("events");

const customEmitter = new EventEmitter();

customEmitter.on("response", function (name, id) {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Data received ${name}, ${id}`);
});

customEmitter.on("response", function () {
  //do something here
  console.log(`Some other logic here`);
});

customEmitter.emit("response", "Yehezkel", 20);

output:
Data received Yehezkel, 20
Some other logic here
