- how http messages are structured?

- two types of http message:

this is what the user is sending 

2. response

to what the user requests 

something about these http messages

the general structure of both 
is similar 
they both have start line, optional headers, 
blank line that indicates all the meta 
info has been sent (headers are the meta info),
also optional body,

HTTP METHODS 
------------

- methods are ways of communicating 
what we wanna do 

4 types of HTTP methods:
1. GET --> read data
this is the default request 
of the browser

2. POST --> insert data
3. PUT --> update data 
4. DELETE --> delete data 

HEADERS 
-------

this is optional which is just 
bassically meta informations 
about our request 

when you add the web, you don't need 
to add these manually
