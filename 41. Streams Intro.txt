STREAMS INTRO 
=============

4 types of streams:
- writeable
write data sequentially

- readable 
read data sequentially

- duplex 
read and write data sequentially

- transform 
data can be modified when writing 
or reading 

note:
streams bassically is used 
to read or write sequentially 

bassically when we have to handle 
and manipulate streaming data 
for example continous source 
or a big file, stream comes real 
handy 

many built in modules in node implements
streaming interface 

stream extends event emitters class
which means we can use events like data 
and end on streams
