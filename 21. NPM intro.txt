NPM INTRO 
=========

- things npm enables us to do:
1. reuse our own code in other project 
2. use code written by other developers 
3. share our own solutions with 
other developers 

this is the link:
https://www.npmjs.com/

- namings 
a. package 
npm calls the reusable codes 
package 

package is bassically a folder 
that contains javascript codes 

this is the same with modules and 
dependencies 

b. modules
this is the same with the package 
and dependencies

c. dependencies
this is the same with package and 
modules 

- important:
a. there's no quality control 
in npm registry 

anyone can publish anything 

b. you can see the security 
of these packages from 
weekly downloads 

if the number is high, it's popular 
then this is battle tested
and is ready to go 

c. if there is a bug, 
there's a good chance that 
someone has already fixed it 
meaning it's already fixed 
in the package or there's 
a written solution
