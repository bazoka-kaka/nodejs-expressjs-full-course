EVENT LOOP SLIDES 
=================

https://course-api.com/

- what it means that javascript is 
synchronous and single threaded?

single threaded --> javascript reads
everything line by line 

- solution if we want to offload 
something to the browser:
when we create browser javascript apps
we have the option of offloading 
to the browser

this doesn't mean 
we can offload the for loop
(it's not gonna work)

but browser provides the api where 
we can offload those tasks to the browser 
and only when the tasks is done then 
we can execute the callback, 
probably the example that we've 
done the most is the fetch 
but we can also do this using setTimeout() 

example:
console.log("first task");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("second task");
}, 0);

console.log("next task");

output:
first task 
next task 
second task 

note:
again it doesn't mean 
that the browser offloads for loops 
but the browser provides some apis 
where we don't have to write
the blocking code 

- we can't offload for loops 
that means we could still write
blocking codes in javascript 
but the browser has some nice api where 
we can offload those time consuming 
tasks 
(the nodejs eventloop api)

- event loop 
event loop meaning we dont
wait one request to be completed 
first, but we do another 
tasks at the same time 

single threading doesn't mean that the
task 
is long or something, but that 
the waiting is the one that is 
preventing another processes to 
happen at the same time, which takes 
time 

event loop bassically do 
all the immediate tasks first 
then the callbacks are 
executed
