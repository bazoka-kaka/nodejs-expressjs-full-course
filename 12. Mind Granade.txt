MIND GRANADE 
============

- example:
first create a file called 7-mind-grenade.js 

this is inside there:
const num1 = 5;
const num2 = 10;

function addValues() {
  console.log("The sum is " + (num1 + num2));
}

addValues();

this is inside the app.js:
require(__dirname + "/7-mind-grenade.js");

note:
notice that the 7-mind-grenade.js is only invoking 
the function and in your app.js it's only 
requiring the module and do nothing 

remember:
when you import a module, you actually invoke it 
the reason is because this code is not just exported 
on its own, when the node exports it, it actually wraps 
it in the function.

therefore if you require the module when you invoke the code, 
you have some kind of function that is executed 
(this is not about exporting something, this is about 
envoking here and there)
