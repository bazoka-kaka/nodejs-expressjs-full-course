CLI 
===

- first you have to create a directory where you're gonna 
put all of your code 

then you're gonna create a new file called app.js 
where you're gonna do all your node things 

this is inside the app.js:
const amount = 12;

if (amount < 10) {
  //
  console.log("Small number");
} else {
  console.log("Large number");
}

console.log("This is my first node app (just joking) : )");

- to execute the program, we have 2 options:
1. in your terminal:
> node app.js 

2. in vsc 
vsc has something called integrated terminal 
(just do the above thing in your vsc terminal!)
