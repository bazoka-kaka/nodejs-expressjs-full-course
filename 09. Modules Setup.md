# MODULES SETUP

## this is the code:

```
//modules
const john = "John";
const peter = "Peter";

const sayHi = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello There" + name);
};

sayHi("Susan");
sayHi(john);
sayHi(peter);
```

note:
it's gonna make sense if the names
would be separate as well as the functions
or the future functions that we're gonna create
then we could access them all throughout the
applications and that way we're gonna have
smaller files and structures to our applications
