# NPM INTRO

- things npm enables us to do:

1. reuse our own code in other project
2. use code written by other developers
3. share our own solutions with
   other developers

- namings
  <br>
  a. package
  <br>
  npm calls the reusable codes
  package
  <br>
  package is bassically a folder
  that contains javascript codes
  <br>
  this is the same with modules and
  dependencies
  <br>
  b. modules
  <br>
  this is the same with the package
  <br>
  and dependencies
  <br>
  c. dependencies
  <br>
  this is the same with package and
  <br>
  modules

- important:
  <br>
  a. there's no quality control
  <br>
  in npm registry
  <br>
  anyone can publish anything
  <br>
  b. you can see the security
  of these packages from
  weekly downloads
  <br>
  if the number is high, it's popular
  then this is battle tested
  and is ready to go
  <br>
  c. if there is a bug,
  there's a good chance that
  someone has already fixed it
  meaning it's already fixed
  in the package or there's
  a written solution
