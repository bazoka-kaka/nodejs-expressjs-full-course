# REPL

- how to get node evaluate our code:

1. REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
2. CLI
   this means that we're running our app code in node

note:
<br>
repl is for playing around and CLI is for everything else

## REPL

  <br>
  <code>> node</code>
  <br>
  example:

  ```
  const name = "John";
  name
  ```

  output:
  <br>
  "John"

- to close the repl:
  press ctrl + c
