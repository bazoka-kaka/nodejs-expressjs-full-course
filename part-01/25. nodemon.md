# NODEMON

- this will allow us not to type
  "node <fileName>.js" every single
  time whenever we're gonna see change
  or restart our code

- installing it

  ```
  > npm i nodemon -D
  ```

  note:
  <br>
  if you wanna save a dev dependency then
  you have to add this:
  <br>
  -D
  <br>
  or
  <br>
  --save-dev

- a dev dependency is just
  a dependency that is gonna be used whenever
  we're doing the development and not
  gonna run whenever we're running
  our actual programs (in production)

- setting up the "scripts"
  in package.json:
  <br>
  the "test" script is not gonna be used
  so we can delete it
  <br>
  we could add something like this
  instead:
  <br>
  "start": "node app.js"
  <br>
  note:
  this is just the same with runnign
  <br>

  ```
  > node app.js
  > in our terminal
  ```

  but we are gonna do something like
  this instead in our terminal:

  ```
  > npm start
  ```

  this is now inside our package.json:

  ```
  {
  "name": "tutorial",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is a tutorial for nodejs and expressjs",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "author": "Yehezkiel Wiradhika",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
  "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^2.0.15"
  }
  }
  ```

- for some commands you can
  simply type "npm start"
  but for some of them, you have
  to provide the full value
  "npm run"
  <br>
  note:
  inside the package.json:
  ```
  "start" = "npm start"
  "dev" = "npm run"
  ```
