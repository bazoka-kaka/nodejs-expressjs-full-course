# BROWSER VS SERVER

## browser:

- DOM
- window
- interactive apps
- no filesystem
- fragmentation
- ES6 modules

## node.js:

- no DOM
  you have no access to browser apis
  this is because they don't exist in node
  (there's no browser):
  no DOM, no geolocation, no fetch, and other cool
  browser functionalities
- no window
- server side apps
- filesystem
  we're gonna be able to access the file inside our windows,
  info about our operating system, respond to network request, etc
- versions
  unlike browser apps which depend on the user browser,
  node depends on the version only this means that if our user's app
  doesn't support a specific feature, it's our responsibility
  to fix it
- commonJS
  unlike browsers where modules are optional,
  nodejs has access to modules by default

<br>

nodejs uses commonJS library for the module
while the general idea is exactly the same with
the es6 modules, syntax is a big difference
