# STREAMS INTRO

4 types of streams:

- writeable
  <br>
  write data sequentially

- readable
  <br>
  read data sequentially

- duplex
  <br>
  read and write data sequentially

- transform
  <br>
  data can be modified when writing
  or reading

note:
<br>
streams bassically is used
to read or write sequentially
<br><br>
bassically when we have to handle
and manipulate streaming data
for example continous source
or a big file, stream comes real
handy
<br><br>
many built in modules in node implements
streaming interface
<br><br>
stream extends event emitters class
which means we can use events like data
and end on streams
