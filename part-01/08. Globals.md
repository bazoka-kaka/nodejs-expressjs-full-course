# GLOBALS

some of the global variables:

```
__dirname --> path to current directory
__filename --> file name
require --> function to use modules
module --> info about current module (file)
process --> info about env where the program
is being executed
```

(using this variable, you are gonna be able to
access things like for example if your app is in
the local then you can access the local but if you
are in the digital ocean for example then you
would have the ability to do something using
your app in the digital ocean since you
know that using this process variable
you are gonna be able to know the current
environment your app is on)

global variables = anywhere in your application
you can access them

example of usage:

```
console.log(\_\_dirname);

setInterval(() => {
console.log("Hello World");
}, 1000);
```

note:

```
setInterval(() => {
//do something
}, 1000);
```

this is gonna do something within the interval
of 1000ms but you can change the time not 1000ms
but something else, for example 200
then the interval is gonna be 200ms , etc etc

you can type:

```
> node app
> instead of
> node app.js
> in your terminal
```
