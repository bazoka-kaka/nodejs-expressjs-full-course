# HTTP MESSAGES

- how http messages are structured?

- two types of http message:

1. request
   <br>
   this is what the user is sending

2. response
   <br>
   the server's response according
   to what the user requests

## something about these http messages

the general structure of both
is similar
they both have start line, optional headers,
blank line that indicates all the meta
info has been sent (headers are the meta info),
also optional body,

## HTTP METHODS

- methods are ways of communicating
  what we wanna do
  <br>
  4 types of HTTP methods:

1. GET --> read data
   this is the default request
   of the browser
2. POST --> insert data
3. PUT --> update data
4. DELETE --> delete data

## REQUEST MESSAGE

### HEADERS

this is optional which is just
bassically meta informations
about our request
<br><br>
when you add the web, you don't need
to add these manually
<br><br>
bassically is just gonna contain information about our request

### BODY

this is also optional, if you just want the resource, there's no body. if you want to add a resource onto the server, then you need to add the body. it's called payload

## RESPONSE MESSAGE

HTTP/1.1. status code and status message (signaling what is the result of the request)
<br>
example:
<br>

<br>
