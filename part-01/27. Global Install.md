# GLOBAL INSTALL

- to install a global dependency:

  > npm i -g <packageName>

- whenever you're installing global
  package, you can install it from
  anywhere from your terminal

- example if you are working with
  gatsby there they have the gatsby-cli
  tool now that's the reason you
  install something globally

- things have changed with the arrival
  of npx, instead of installing
  global packages globally using
  npm i -g, we can just use npx
  <br>
  note:
  this happens since there are
  lots of things with installing
  using global variables, you
  should just install dependencies
  locally using npm
  or globally using npx

- npx stands for execute and
  the official name is the package runner
  <br>
  this is a feature that was introduced in
  npm 5.2 the idea is following
  where you can run that cli tool,
  without installing it globally
  <br>
  (this is available throughout your
  computer, but it's not gonna be installed
  globally)
