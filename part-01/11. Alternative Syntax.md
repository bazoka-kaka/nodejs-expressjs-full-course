# ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX

- there's another way of doing this and this is
  called export as you go
  <br>
  example:
  <br>
  first you have to create a new file called 6-alternate.js
  <br>
  this is inside there:

  ```
  module.exports.items = ["item1", "item2"];
  const person = {
    name: "Bob",
  };

  module.exports.singlePerson = person;
  ```

  <br>
  this is inside app.js:

  ```
  const data = require(\_\_dirname + "/6-alternate.js");
  console.log(data);
  ```

  this is the output:
  { items: [ 'item1', 'item2' ], singlePerson: { name: 'Bob' } }
