# ASYNC PATTERN - BLOCKING CODE

```
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  if (req.url === "/") {
    res.end("Home Page");
  } else if (req.url === "/about") {
    //BLOCKING CODE !!!
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
      for (let j = 0; j < 1000; ++j) {
        console.log(`${i} ${j}`);
      }
    }
    res.end("About Page");
  }
  res.end("Error Page");
});

server.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("Server started at port 3000");
});
```

note:
<br>
when the user is going to the about
page, this is gonna take some time
<br><br>
when the user goes to the about page,
then we try to go to the home page
for example then we're gonna
have to wait until the
about page completed loading
<br><br>
this is why we need asynchronous
to do this. because if you do it async, the data will be offloaded and only when the data is back then we invoke it
