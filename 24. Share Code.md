# SHARE CODE

- if we wanna push to the github,
  we're gonna have to ignore the node_modules
  file because it's too big!
  <br>
  we have to create a file called:
  <br>
  .gitignore
  <br>
  note:
  <br>
  this is the list of files and folders
  that we're not gonna include
  while pushing to the github
  <br>
  if you wanna include a folder
  inside .gitignore you have to add "/"
  in the beginning of your folder's name
  <br>
  example:
  <br>
  /node_modules
