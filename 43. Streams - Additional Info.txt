ADDITIONAL INFO 
===============

- the data is ... bytes, but we can control 
it by passing in the object when 
we're setting up create read stream 

- last buffer - remainder 
- highWaterMark - control size 
example:
const stream = createReadStream("./components/big1.txt", {
  highWaterMark: 90000,
  encoding: "utf-8",
});

you can also pass in the error request:
stream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.log(err);
});

full code:
const { createReadStream } = require("fs");

const stream = createReadStream("./components/big1.txt", {
  highWaterMark: 90000,
  encoding: "utf8",
});

stream.on("data", (result) => {
  console.log(result);
});

stream.on("error", (err) => {
  console.log(err);
});
