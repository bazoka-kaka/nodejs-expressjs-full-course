FIRST PACKAGE 
=============

- package .json --> manifest file 
(stores important info about project
/package)

- 2 ways to create package.json:
1. manual approach 
you just have to create package.json 
in a root 
(you have to install package.json in 
the root dir)

here you have to create each properties 

2. npm init 
> npm init 
this is gonna ask you questions step 
by step 

or you can just do something like this:
> npm init -y 
note:
this is gonna say yes to all the questions 

- why need package.json?
store the information of modules 
that you've installed locally 

all the dependencies files 
are gonna be inside node_modules 
folder 

note:
if you install a dependency sometimes, 
the dependency is gonna have 
another dependency so it'll 
automatically be installed in our 
current project along with 
that dependency

example:
using lodash 
> npm i lodash 

inside your app.js:
const _ = require("lodash");

const items = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
const newItems = _.flattenDeep(items);

console.log(newItems);

output:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

note:
_.flattenDeep() --> this is gonna 
make multiple level array into 
one level array
