FIRST MODULE 
============ 

- modules = encapsulated code (only share minimum)
note:
only share minimum meaning that we're only 
sharing what we want 

- CommonJS --> this is what the library 
that node uses under the hood 

and therefore every file in a node is a module 
(by default)

- example:
create a new file called 4-names.js 
then copy all in your app.js 
there 

this is inside 4-names.js now:
const secret = "SUPER SECRET";
const john = "John";
const peter = "Peter";

create another file called 5-utils.js 
then copy the functions from your app.js 
there 

this is inside utils.js:
const sayHi = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello There" + name);
};

- then you have to export from the module 
this is the export from 4-names.js:
const john = "John";
const peter = "Peter";

module.exports = { john, peter };

this is the export from 5-utils.js:
const sayHi = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello There " + name);
};

module.exports = sayHi;

- then you have to import from the module 
this is inside the app.js:
const names = require(__dirname + "/4-names.js");
const sayHi = require(__dirname + "/5-utils.js");
console.log(names);

sayHi("Susan");
sayHi(names.john);
sayHi(names.peter);

output:
{ john: 'John', peter: 'Peter' }
Hello There Susan
Hello There John 
Hello There Peter
