FS MODULE (ASYNC)
-----------------
- asynchronously meaning unblocking

- async functions are not gonna be 
called whenever we call it!
this is gonna be called when a certain 
condition inside the code is happening
(triggered by something else)

- whenever you're using async 
function then you're gonna need callback 
functions 

- readFile() 
this is gonna read the file's content 

- writeFile() 
this is gonna write into the file 

- final code:
const { readFile, writeFile } = require("fs");

readFile("./content/first.txt", "utf-8", function (err, results) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return null;
  }
  const first = results;
  readFile("./content/second.txt", "utf-8", function (err, res) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return null;
    }
    const second = res;
    writeFile(
      "./content/results-sync.txt",
      `Here is the results: ${first}, ${second}`,
      function (err, results) {
        if (err) {
          console.log(err);
          return null;
        }
      }
    );
  });
});
