SHARE CODE 
==========

- if we wanna push to the github, 
we're gonna have to ignore the node_modules 
file because it's too big!

we have to create a file called:
.gitignore 

note:
this is the list of files and folders 
that we're not gonna include 
while pushing to the github 

if you wanna include a folder 
inside .gitignore you have to add "/"
in the beginning of your folder's name 

example:
/node_modules
