STREAMS - READ FILES 
====================

- use case:
using streams when we're reading files 
because we need to understand one 
thing:
when we use the sync approach, 
what happens: we're reading the whole 
file 

but if we have a big file 
you're just using all of that memory 
and as the file gets bigger and bigger 
the variable isn't gonna be good enough 
(the size is too big and you can't put 
anything in the string anymore)

solution:
read stream option 

example:
first create a big file:
const { writeFileSync } = require("fs");
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
  //
  writeFileSync("./components/bigFile.txt", `Hello World ${i}\n`, {
    flag: "a",
  });
}

we read it like this:
const { createReadStream } = require("fs");

const stream = createReadStream("./components/bigFile.txt", "utf-8");

stream.on("data", function (data) {
  console.log(data);
});
