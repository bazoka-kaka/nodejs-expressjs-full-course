# package-log.json

- why do we need it?
  for version control, meaning if
  the person are using your product
  but they are running on dependency
  with different version, then
  it's gonna be absolute or there
  would be some bugs there
  <br>
  package-log.json contains the specific
  versions of dependencies and
  the dependencies that those dependencies
  are using

- there are three values in the
  version of dependencies in
  package-log.json
  <br>
  example:
  <br>
  "lodash": "^4.17.20"
  <br>
  4 --> this is a major change
  meaning if this changes
  then there are some break and change
  <br>
  17 --> this is a minor one
  (backward compatible), meaning if
  this changes to 18 then we shouldn't
  expect any break and changes
  <br>
  20 --> this is just a patch
  for the bug fix
