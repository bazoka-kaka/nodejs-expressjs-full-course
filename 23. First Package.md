# FIRST PACKAGE

- package .json --> manifest file
  (stores important info about project
  /package)

- 2 ways to create package.json:
  1. manual approach
     you just have to create package.json
     in a root
     (you have to install package.json in
     the root dir)
     <br>
     here you have to create each properties
  2. npm init
  ```
  > npm init
  > this is gonna ask you questions step
  > by step
  ```
  or you can just do something like this:
  ```
  > npm init -y
  > note:
  > this is gonna say yes to all the questions
  ```
- why need package.json?
  store the information of modules
  that you've installed locally
  <br>
  all the dependencies files
  are gonna be inside node_modules
  folder
  <br>
  note:
  <br>
  if you install a dependency sometimes,
  the dependency is gonna have
  another dependency so it'll
  automatically be installed in our
  current project along with
  that dependency
  <br>
  example:
  <br>
  using lodash
  <br>

  > npm i lodash

    <br>
    inside your app.js:

  ```
  const \_ = require("lodash");

  const items = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
  const newItems = \_.flattenDeep(items);

  console.log(newItems);
  ```

  output:
  <br>
  [1, 2, 3, 4]
  <br>
  note:
  <br>
  \_.flattenDeep() --> this is gonna
  make multiple level array into
  one level array
